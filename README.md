# A Next.js starter file.

Implements the following libraries and or technologies.

- [SCSS + CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [StoryBoard.js](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Jest + React Testing Library](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Playwright.js](https://playwright.dev/)
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## Testing

Jest + React Testing Library have been implemented for Unit testing and Playwright have been setup for end-to-end (e2e) testing. I leveraged both Next.js testing documentation and [this tutorial](https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/how-to-set-up-nextjs-with-jest-react-testing-library-and-playwright). CI/CD test runners with GitHub Actions have not been setup, but should be when leveragin this template for serious projects.
